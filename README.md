# Inverted_Index
Implement an inverted index by passing a collection of documents as parameters.
## Overview üìã
The code performs the following functions:

1- Check if every file and folder we need is ready, and prepare them if they are not.

2- Preprocesses the data in the text collection (stop words removal, stemming, removing punctuations etc.)

3- Create midpoints.

4- Create json file with the results.

## Running the code üîß
*Python 3, nltk and json are required to run the code*

Ensure all the files from the repo are present in the same directory.

Open the project in any preferred IDE of your choice and run the Inverted_Index.py file, passing as argument several documents, files are recommended to be stored in the Documents folder.
